# 🔴 COPY-PASTE FOR EMPLOYEE

## HERE IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

### REQUIREMENT 1: Import Must Actually Work
- Not "merge to me" or "soon"
- PROOF: Screenshots + database confirmation

### REQUIREMENT 2: Send Me This Evidence

When you test import, I need EXACT output of:

**A) Network Tab Screenshot:**

In DevTools (F12) → Network tab → click the `/video-categories/3/import` request:

```
URL:
Method (POST/GET):
Status Code:
Response (paste what you see):
```

**B) Console Screenshot:**

DevTools → Console tab → (paste any text that appears)

**C) Server Logs During Import:**

```bash
cd /var/www/iptv-panel
tail -n 200 storage/logs/laravel.log
```

Paste EVERYTHING you see after you click Import.

**D) Route List:**

```bash
cd /var/www/iptv-panel
php artisan route:list | egrep "video-categories.*browse|import"
```

Paste output exactly.

**E) Database Count:**

```bash
cd /var/www/iptv-panel
php artisan tinker --execute="echo \App\Models\Video::count().PHP_EOL;"
```

Before import: [number]

After import: [number]

Should be +1 higher.

## WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

✅ Network shows: Status **200** or **302**

✅ Page reloads automatically

✅ You see: **"✅ Imported: 1 video"** (green message)

✅ Video gets badge: **"✓ Imported"**

✅ Checkbox becomes disabled

✅ Database count increases by 1

---

## WHAT FAILURE LOOKS LIKE

❌ Network shows: **404** or **405** or **419** or **500**

❌ Page doesn't reload

❌ No green message

❌ Database count doesn't change

❌ Console shows red errors

---

## QUICK TEST (5 MINUTES)

```bash
# 1. Check before
cd /var/www/iptv-panel
echo "BEFORE:" && php artisan tinker --execute="echo \App\Models\Video::count().PHP_EOL;"

# 2. Open browser
# Go to: http://your-server/video-categories/3/browse
# Click checkbox
# Click "Import Selected"
# Wait for page reload

# 3. Check after
echo "AFTER:" && php artisan tinker --execute="echo \App\Models\Video::count().PHP_EOL;"
```

If AFTER number is higher than BEFORE number → ✅ IT WORKS

If same number → ❌ IT DOESN'T WORK

---

## PERFORMANCE CHECK

If page is slow when browsing `/video-categories/3/browse`:

```bash
cd /var/www/iptv-panel

# How many files?
find /media/videos/FILME/ACTIUNE -type f | wc -l

# If > 100, that's why slow
# Solution: Pagination or limit list to 50 items
```

---
